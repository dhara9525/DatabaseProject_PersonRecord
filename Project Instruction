Goal is to keep track of people who have multiple addresses and multiple phone numbers


Please create a relational database schema and show examples of the following queries:


- Display people and their phone numbers

- Display people and their addresses

- Display people and their addresses only if they are in the state of California

- Show how many people have addresses in each state

- Show the % of people that have multiple addresses
